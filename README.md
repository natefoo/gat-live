# Galaxy Admin Training

This repository was created during the [live, in-person Galaxy Admin Training held during 17-21 April, 2023 in Ghent, Belgium](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2023-admin-training/), as a result of completing the trainings [on the schedule](https://github.com/orgs/galaxyproject/projects/28/views/1?filterQuery=).
